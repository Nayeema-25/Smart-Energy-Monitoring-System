PROJECT OVERVIEW
Smart Energy Monitoring System

This project aims to develop a Smart Home Energy Monitoring and Management System (SHEMS) using the ESP32 Wi-Fi module and Blynk IoT platform.
It enables real-time tracking of voltage, current, power, and energy cost. The system displays live data through a mobile app and web dashboard,
helping users visualize consumption patterns and manage appliances more efficiently.




PROBLEM STATEMENT

Conventional meters lack real-time monitoring, detailed insights, and appliance-level tracking. 
This project addresses the need for an IoT-based system that allows remote access, individual appliance analysis, cost tracking,
and improved energy management in smart homes.



PROJECT OBJECTIVES

> Design a low-cost IoT-based energy monitoring system using ESP32 and current/voltage sensors.

> Display real-time power metrics (voltage, current, power, cost) on the Blynk app.

> Provide daily usage analytics and remote access via mobile or web interface.

> Enable alerts when consumption exceeds set thresholds.

> Implement load control features for appliances via the Blynk app.

> Ensure accuracy through calibration and testing.

 > Offer scalable architecture for future smart grid and renewable integration.
