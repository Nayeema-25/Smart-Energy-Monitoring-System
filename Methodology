This part gives the overall in-depth information about the project.
It also involves aspect of the project, such as design, implementation and modelling, software implementation 
and simulation software used in our project.

1. The ESP32 microcontroller collects data from the ZMPT101B voltage sensor and 

SCT-013-030 current sensor.

2. The calculated power consumption (in watts) is displayed.

3. The total electricity cost is calculated based on predefined tariffs.

4. The power usage data is transmitted to the Blynk IoT app via Wi-Fi.
