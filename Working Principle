● The ZMPT101B module measures the AC voltage of the connected load.

● The SCT-013-030 sensor detects the current flowing through the circuit.

● The ESP32 calculates the power consumption using the formula:
Power (W) = Voltage (V) × Current (A)

● The total energy consumed is computed as:
Energy (kWh) = Power (W) × Time (h).

● The total electricity bill is calculated based on the per-unit cost.

● The data is updated on the Blynk app in the form of numerical values.
