RESULT

 We have obtained real-time monitoring of voltage, current, energy and total

power consumption.

 We can monitor the result in Blynk IoT application.

 Below figure 2 shows model of Smart Energy Monitoring System.

 Here the input is voltage sensor & current sensor, after calculating voltage &

current the information is send to ESP32 Wi-Fi module which stores the data

& sends to single channel relay which is our output.
