The project code for the Smart Energy Monitoring System was written using the Arduino programming framework and uploaded to the ESP32 microcontroller via USB. 
The process involved the following steps:



1. Software & Libraries Used:

Platform: Arduino (with ESP32 board support)

Code Editor/Compiler: Arduino-compatible tool (e.g., PlatformIO / Arduino CLI)

Required Libraries:

EmonLib – for energy parameter monitoring

BlynkSimpleEsp32 – for IoT dashboard and connectivity

EEPROM, WiFi, WiFiClient – for persistent memory and networking





2. Uploading Steps:

1. Connect the ESP32 board to your computer via USB.


2. Open the code in your Arduino-compatible environment.


3. Select the board: ESP32 Dev Module.


4. Choose the appropriate port (COM/tty) for the connected ESP32.


5. Compile and upload the code to the board.




3. Post Upload Actions:

Open the Serial Monitor at 115200 baud rate to observe live readings of:

Voltage (Vrms)

Current (Irms)

Power and Energy Consumption


Launch the Blynk IoT mobile app:

Use the appropriate widgets to monitor real-time energy metrics.

Control appliances based on energy thresholds set in the app.
